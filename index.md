# Hi, I am Tong Qi

I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Mathematics](https://stat.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland. I am honored to be advised by [Professor Vince Lyzinski](https://www.math.umd.edu/~vlyzinsk/). 

My research interests are in the areas of graph theory, statistical network analysis, and high-dimensional data analysis. My current work focuses on statistical inference on spectral graph embedding algorithms and their performance comparison.



# Projects
#### 1. Community Detection and Anomaly Detection of Multiple Graph Embedding Methods
