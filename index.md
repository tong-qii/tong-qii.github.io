I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Maryland. I am honored to be advised by [Professor Vince Lyzinski](https://www.math.umd.edu/~vlyzinsk/). 

My research interests are in the areas of graph theory and network analysis. My current work focuses on algorithms of spectral graph embedding and performance.
